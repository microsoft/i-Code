# Contributing

This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

We use the GitHub issue tracker to discuss new features and non-trivial bugs.

In addition to the issue tracker, [#journeys on
Slack](https://dwopen.slack.com) is the best way to get into contact with the
project's maintainers.

To contribute code, documentation, or tests, please submit a pull request to
the GitHub repository. Generally, we expect two maintainers to review your pull
request before it is approved for merging. For more details, see the
[MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS.md) page.
